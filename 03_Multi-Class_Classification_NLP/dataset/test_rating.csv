10766,2,"I felt like this author was in a race against time to finish this book . I was disappointed by the shortness of it .Woman gets thrown overboard ,gets rescued by seal man , has sex in front of everybody for binding ceremony and then off to make evil stepmother and stepsister pay , THE END ! (duh) If more thought had gone onto it ,I hope it could have been better . Now I'm iffy about this author .",A race to finish ?
10768,4,Great plot and characters and twists and interesting ways of explaining the characteristics of the fantasy creatures. A little long on emotional details.,Good
10779,5,Wonderful wonderful book I loved each and every word in it. I wonder if Ricard will find a love in a part two of this book I find I need to read more about this game family. How does nikki like Ireland and does she ever get to see her home land again?.,Tami's thoughts
